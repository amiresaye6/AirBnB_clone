# HTML and CSS Basics

This repository covers fundamental concepts of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It provides explanations and examples for the following topics:

1. **What is HTML**: HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure of a web page using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and more.

2. **How to create an HTML page**: To create an HTML page, you'll need a text editor and a basic understanding of HTML syntax. Start with an `<html>` tag and build your content from there.

3. **What is a markup language**: A markup language is a system for annotating text to give it structure and meaning. HTML uses tags to define elements and their relationships.

4. **What is the DOM (Document Object Model)**: The DOM represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. It allows programs to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page.

5. **What is an element / tag**: Elements are the building blocks of HTML. They are represented by tags (e.g., `<p>` for paragraphs) and define the content and structure of a web page.

6. **What is an attribute**: Attributes provide additional information about elements. They are always included in the opening tag and are used to customize the behavior or appearance of an element.

7. **How does the browser load a webpage**: When you enter a URL, the browser performs a series of steps to retrieve, parse, and render the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up a webpage.

8. **What is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: CSS is a stylesheet language used for styling web pages. It allows you to control the layout, colors, and fonts of your HTML content.

9. **How to add style to an element**: CSS styles are applied to HTML elements using selectors and declarations. You can set properties like color, font-size, and margin to control the appearance.

10. **What is a class**: A class is a way to apply a specific set of styles to one or more elements. It allows you to group elements and style them collectively.

11. **What is a selector**: Selectors target specific elements for styling. They can be based on element names, classes, IDs, or other attributes.

12. **How to compute CSS Specificity Value**: Specificity determines which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules conflict. It is calculated based on the combination of selectors used.

13. **What are Box properties in CSS**: Box properties in CSS refer to attributes that control the dimensions and spacing of an element, including width, height, padding, and margin.
